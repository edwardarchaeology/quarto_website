## Industries served

I work across sectors where location, risk, and change matter. Below are common examples and short mini-cases.

<section class="industries-grid">

<div class="industry-card">
### Energy & Utilities

Map corridor routing and encroachment risk around critical assets. Prioritise maintenance with satellite-detected change.

_Mini case: Pipeline Corridor Risk Mapping_ — combined easement data, SAR change alerts, and field tickets to flag hotspots.
</div>

<div class="industry-card">
### Real Estate & Retail

Score sites with demand, drive-time, and competition. Design territories to reduce cannibalisation and improve coverage.

_Mini case: Multi-Site Expansion Playbook_ — tract scoring and trade-area maps delivered as an executive shortlist.
</div>

<div class="industry-card">
### Logistics & Mobility

Optimize territories and routes to lower miles and stabilise ETAs. Visualise service coverage for capacity planning.

_Mini case: Distributor Territory Redesign_ — rebalanced zones and removed route overlap with clear KPIs.
</div>

<div class="industry-card">
### Environmental & Coastal

Monitor shoreline change and wetlands with time-series remote sensing and produce compliance-ready reporting.

_Mini case: Coastal Erosion Monitoring Pilot_ — NDWI/NDVI trends with an alerting dashboard.
</div>

<div class="industry-card">
### Agriculture

Map crop health and variability (NDVI anomalies) and delineate yield zones for targeted interventions.

_Mini case: Field Variability Mapping_ — Sentinel-2 indices guiding in-field checks and inputs.
</div>

<div class="industry-card">
### Insurance & Finance

Portfolio exposure mapping with hazard overlays and event monitoring for rapid triage.

_Mini case: Portfolio Exposure Heatmaps_ — unified parcel-level risk layers for underwriting reviews.
</div>
