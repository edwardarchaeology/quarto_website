## A minimal R Shiny app with spatial data

This writeup describes a small R Shiny application used as a proof of concept for sharing geospatial data interactively without requiring users to install desktop GIS software.

The app:

- Scrapes current Waffle House locations from the public website.
- Plots them on an interactive map.
- Lets the user draw a synthetic disaster area with configurable radii.
- Performs real‑time CRS transformations and distance calculations to render the impact zone correctly.

Despite its simplicity, the app demonstrates:

- Reactive user input bound to spatial calculations.
- Automated data refresh via web scraping.
- How quickly an audience‑friendly, shareable GIS interface can be built with Shiny.
