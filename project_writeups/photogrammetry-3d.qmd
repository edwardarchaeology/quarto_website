## SFM 3D Model Building

**Project description:** Photogrammetric model construction of various fossils. Different subjects were chosen for different levels of model building difficulty. 

### Overview of Methods

The following number of photos were captured for each model:

- Ammonite Wall: 228 photos
- Marine Skeletal Fossil: 230 photos
- Single Ammonite: 92 photos
- Hearth: 164 photos
- Second Ammonite Wall: 247 photos

Total data collection time was approximately 3 hours. Models were built in Agisoft on the lowest possible settings to investigate whether or not presentation/publication worthy models could be built quickly with low computational requirements. The results were great for this purpose and show that even for relatively difficult subjects, detailed models could be constructed.
