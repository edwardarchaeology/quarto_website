## About {.about-heading}

Hello and welcome!

I'm **Edward Leland**, a New Orleans–based geospatial & data scientist
helping private teams turn messy data and satellite imagery into clear decisions.
I build maps, models, and dashboards that answer questions like where to expand,
how to reduce risk, and what's driving performance.
Typical engagements include site selection & territory mapping, satellite-based
monitoring, market/demand analysis, and executive KPIs and decision dashboards.
Delivery is fast, visual, and actionable—so your team can move with confidence.

### Approach:

1. **Scope** – clarify decisions & data.  
2. **Model** – pipeline construction, model development, and final analysis.  
3. **Deliver** – decision-ready dashboards, applications, and briefs.

### Tooling:

Python · R · SQL · Tableau/PowerBI · PostGIS · QGIS · GDAL · Google Earth Engine
