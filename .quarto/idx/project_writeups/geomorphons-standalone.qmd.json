QGIS offers an exceptionally quick version of this via its use of the GRASS r.geomorphon processing method. One easily seen use of this is for the following archaeological application. In the satellite image below, nothing stands out:\n\n![](../assets/project_images/morphs/SAT.png?raw=true)\n\nYet if we use r.geomorphon on a DEM of the area (in this case constructed via processing tiled LIDAR point clouds into one continuous surface) we see an interesting feature arise on the mountain top:\n\n![](../assets/project_images/morphs/MORPH.png?raw=true)\n\nExtracting just the ridge features from the data set gives:\n\n![](../assets/project_images/morphs/Ridge.png?raw=true)\n\nThe circular ridge layers highlighted by the red circle define a site of archaeological interest currently under study. This technique could be extended upon by running it over large DEM's and using a machine learning classifier to extract tiles where similar features are found. This could lead to an extremely quick method to discovering this type of hilltop archaeological site. \n\nNow, when trying to perform this calculation over a series of raster images I kept having to run each image individually as r.geomorphon would get hung up after batch processing sometimes just two raster files. I could have run everything from the command line but I wanted a more elegan solution. \n\n### Standalone Code\n\nGetting QGIS to work with an IDE is pretty simple especially if you are looking to run it in a Jupyter notebook:\n\n1.
